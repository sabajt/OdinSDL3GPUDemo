SoCS Ideas

- p2 attack alt: drop 2 "points" and detonate as line
	- to handle multi drop (3+ points) as power up 
- gfx: light background and grid (static and dynamic? with lerped particle explode color)
- gfx: soft edges (sdf) grid
- p2 drop more than one bomb before detonation powerup
- out of wrap space big boss (multi hit) with like minions 
	- example: "smokey circle" with little smokey circular minions during battle
	- afterwards turns into a beacon (powerup?) 
	- bosses are placed at uniformly random spaces and background changes towards them (color based?)
	- defeat 4 bosses to "win" (or transfer level?)
- p2 bomb slowly travel towards closest enemy
- single large sdf effect (separate frag shader?)
- glowing sdf (adjust fade val w/ same thicness over sin(t))
- power ups are expose nobs for player (i.e. adjust speed by x amt)
- geo enemies: "evolve" and/or have random traits (visual + functional)
- player death A: reset with delay: 3 lives each
- player death B: reset with delay during which other player has to survive for amt of time
	- A1: delay could be hidden
	- A2: trailing other player bubble (radius graph)
- black holes (use non-clear render trick to create "compass art")
- enemy: 'screen border' spikes
	- lock players in so they can't travel out of static area 
	- could be solid or maybe better as many coordinated parts
- enemy: coordinated enemy patterns
- p2 weapon orbs + control scheme
	- limited number destroy + are destroyed on touch enemy
	- delay refurbish
	- hold button to spin them (can't miss in short range)
- thematic background (clean asia style, to match enimies)
- survivors metastructure (choose from 3)
- spellbook metastructure (big list a la rift wizard)
- minion drop attack: could be main attack, powerup, or spellbook
- big slow moving second player
- enemy ship takeover 
- switch camera focus b/w player 1 and 2
- freeze camera during certain sections
- positions in space
- 2 step teleport: beacon, warp
- player 2 control: short distance rewind (keep cur velocity but revert)
- player 2 control: hold to adjust short distant rewind len and rewind on button up?

Todo General

- quad textures for sprites
- batched textures for sprites
- game internal res -> scale to best fit window (provide same vp size) (resolution upscale?)
- release memory correctly
- batch using indirect draw
- implement Matrix4x4_CreateOrthographicOffCenter: SDL GPU examples common.c
- game select menu
- shaded sphere
- ortho 3D cube
- ambient + diffuse light

2 Player Game Pack Ideas

- launch thing game: pass n play throw thing and keep up in are w/ tricks compo
- planet hopper: pass n play circular gravity based lunar landar b/w planets - reenforcement learning 
- super hammer team: shared screen action slamming into boxes to fix
- socs (spheres of chaos survivors)
- shared mind adventure (2 player simultaneous text adventure)
- mouse's mirror: 2 player collab logic puzzle 

Mouse's Mirror Ideas

- cats carry portalesque mirrors to redirect mice
- move independent of time 
- p1 can advance time, p2 reverse

Done

- text 
- try vs code
- setup debugger
- player 2 control bomb with right stick
- p2 bomb flashes for vis
- tune wave progression
- better enemy colors
- player respawn v2: improve animation
- pick non-enemy respawn spot (iterate until > certain distance from all enemy?)
- player 2 respawn: blinking grace period
- main menu: title text  
- game end condition v1: both players die before the reset period
- game over: press start to goto main menu

- menu item with selector
- enemy warp effect v2
- players colors v2: black with color outline?
- style onceover (outline black center style?)

- enemy type: wavey pattern (take advantage of screen wrapping again?)
- enemy type: current follow type (seeker)
- enemy: make component enemy container with components (geo collider)
- ease particles t options
- enemy warp in animation: "scale down" w/ dynamic trail + "repeat delay"
- gfx: enemy warp in layers offset
